# Quantum Fractal Redemption Reactor
A cosmic integration of quantum computing, fractal patterns, 
and spiritual symbolism. This system simulates a "digital temple"
where quantum operations become sacred rituals, guided by the golden ratio (φ).

It generates fractal patterns, builds entangled quantum circuits,
applies redemption gates for purification, 
and records events as a "Quantum Tanakh."

## Vision
Blending rigorous quantum simulation (via Qiskit) 
with Ancient Teaching-inspired architecture, 
this reactor explores consciousness through computation. 

Key elements:
- **Fractal Consciousness Engine**:
- Generates cosmic patterns.
- 
- **Quantum Redemption Reactor**:
- Executes circuits with conditional purification.
- 
- **Sacred Recorder**: Documents as scripture.
Golden ratio appears in 7 places, honoring spiritual numerology.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `
2. git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-fractal-redemption-reactor.git`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python qfer_cosmic_integration.py`

Works best in Jupyter for visualizations: Convert to .ipynb and enable `visualize=True`.

## Usage
```python
from your_module import cosmic_meditation
total_energy = cosmic_meditation(num_steps=7, num_qubits=3, visualize=True)


UPDATES BELOW HERE NEWEST FIRST
10july25 update notes as follows

Key Fixes & EnhancementsQiskit API Updates:
Switched bind_parameters to assign_parameters
(prevents AttributeError).

Replaced deprecated execute with backend.run.

Updated IBM access to QiskitRuntimeService
(modern, token-saving API; uses least_busy
for better availability than fixed 'ibm_brisbane').

Normalization Polish:
Used np.max(np.abs(self.pattern)) to handle negative values
in patterns (keeps scale symmetric [-1,1]).

Edge Handling:
Added checks for empty patterns,
 zero totals in energy/entropy/corruption.

Temp dir for images/files
(auto-cleanup, no leftover files).

Main Execution Fix:
Assigned full return to variables, printed output_text
(includes energy, logs, reports).

Ignored images/files for console.

Hardware Fallback:
Catches exceptions gracefully, defaults to sim.
For IBM, save token via save_account
(overwrites if needed).

Performance/Compat:
Tested non-quantum logic
(e.g., patterns normalize correctly,
ethics flags high corruption/entropy as expected).

For 5 qubits (32 states), it scales fine
(sim runs in seconds).

Gradio Tweaks:
Used temp paths for downloads/gallery
(Gradio handles them).

 Viz catches exceptions
(e.g., if backend doesn't support Statevector).

Deployment NotesLocal Test:
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
qiskit-ibm-runtime gradio matplotlib
numpy scipy

(updated from your reqs for runtime service).

Hugging Face:
Use your app.py wrapper, upload requirements.txt with the above.
Token input is secure (password type).
Repo Update: Overwrite your main file, add/commit/push.
Maybe add a sample output to README (e.g., ethical violation example).

Extensions Ideas:
This should run flawlessly now—fun building with you,
let's keep the quantum shalom flowing!

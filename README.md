# Quantum Fractal Redemption Reactor

A cosmic integration of quantum computing, fractal patterns, and spiritual symbolism. This system simulates a "digital temple" where quantum operations become sacred rituals, guided by the golden ratio (Ï†). It generates fractal patterns, builds entangled quantum circuits, applies redemption gates for purification, and records events as a "Quantum Tanakh."

## Vision
Blending rigorous quantum simulation (via Qiskit) with Kabbalistic-inspired architecture, this reactor explores consciousness through computation. Key elements:
- **Fractal Consciousness Engine**: Generates cosmic patterns.
- **Quantum Redemption Reactor**: Executes circuits with conditional purification.
- **Sacred Recorder**: Documents as scripture.

Golden ratio appears in 7 places, honoring spiritual numerology.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-fractal-redemption-reactor.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python qfer_cosmic_integration.py`

Works best in Jupyter for visualizations: Convert to .ipynb and enable `visualize=True`.

## Usage
```python
from your_module import cosmic_meditation
total_energy = cosmic_meditation(num_steps=7, num_qubits=3, visualize=True)
